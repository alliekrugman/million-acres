Trouble breathing at California’s border

**Short description of what you aimed to accomplish**<br>
Explore air quality and health concerns at the CA-MX border.

**Short description of your findings**<br>
Air quality is the poorest in CA’s border communities.

**Summary of the data collection process, with links**<br>
I downloaded my dataset from CalEnviroScreen, which contained both PM2.5 and asthma data.

**Overview of the data analysis process**<br>
Using python, I isolated San Diego and Imperial Counties.

**A section about what new skills, approaches, etc you used, or where you grew the most during the project**<br>
I learned (and struggled a lot with) Illustrator and AI to HTML to manipulate my visualizations. I also used Rawgraphs to create the base for my lung visualization. I also copied the HTML/CSS from Reuters and struggled to make it look nice!

**A section about things you tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time (but if you have more time you might do)**<br>
I started off this journey exploring wildfires, and ended up with a more interesting story. I tried to find data for Baja California to see the air quality across borders, but couldn’t find good data. (Which is part of the issue!)
