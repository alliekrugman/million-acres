**Trouble breathing at California’s border**
<br><br>
This project, completed as my second project for Columbia's Lede Program for Data Journalism, explores air quality and health concerns at the CA-MX border. Using data from CalEnviroScreen, I found that air quality -- measured by PM2.5 levels -- is the poorest in CA’s border communities, much worse than other areas in the region. Using python, I isolated San Diego and Imperial Counties.

To investigate why this may be the case, I visited the website of nonprofit advocacy group Casa Familiar and researched local news stories on the issue.

To create my visualizations, I used Datawrapper, Rawgraphs, Adobe Illustrator, and AI to HTML. The header video was a clip edited from a local news story in Adobe Premiere Rush, and the HTML/CSS was pulled and edited from a Reuters article.
