* Title
Trouble breathing at California’s border

* Short description of what you aimed to accomplish
Explore air quality and health concerns at the CA-MX border.

* Short description of your findings
Air quality is the poorest in CA’s border communities.

* Summary of the data collection process, with links
I downloaded my dataset from CalEnviroScreen, which contained both PM2.5 and asthma data.

* Overview of the data analysis process
Using python, I isolated San Diego and Imperial Counties.

* A section about what new skills, approaches, etc you used, or where you grew the most during the project
I learned (and struggled a lot with) Illustrator and AI to HTML to manipulate my visualizations. I also used Rawgraphs to create the base for my lung visualization. I also copied the HTML/CSS from Reuters and struggled to make it look nice!

* A section about things you tried to do or wanted to do but did not have the skills/time (but if you have more time you might do)

I started off this journey exploring wildfires, and ended up with a more interesting story. I tried to find data for Baja California to see the air quality across borders, but couldn’t find good data. (Which is part of the issue!)
